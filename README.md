# 🧠 AI-Powered Meeting Minutes Extractor

A lightweight **Node.js + Express** backend service that uses the **OpenAI API** to analyze meeting notes and return structured summaries, key decisions, and action items in JSON format.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

This API allows you to:

- Submit raw meeting notes (as text or `.txt` file)
- Automatically extract:
  - ✅ A 2–3 sentence **summary**
  - ✅ A list of **key decisions**
  - ✅ A structured list of **action items** (`task`, `owner`, `deadline`)
- Receive results as a clean, well-structured **JSON response**
